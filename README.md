# USER STORIES

1. The user can interact with a Tamagotchi-style game interface.
2. The user's virtual pet can eat, play, sleep, and fight. 
3. Each option has two buttons which impact both the target score and overall points average.
4. A dynamic header reflects changes to the overall health score of the pet.
5. The user can choose to personalize their pet by uploading an image (via url) to the site.
6. The pet's score cannot exceed 100. If the pet's score reaches 0, the pet will die.
