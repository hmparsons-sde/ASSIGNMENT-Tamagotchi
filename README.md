# OVERVIEW

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate maturation of Vanilla JS, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, and modularization competencies. 

# USER STORIES

1. The user can play an interactive, dynamic game with a Tamagotchi-style virtual pet.
2. The pet can eat, play, sleep, and fight. Each option has two buttons which impact both the target score and overall points average.
3. Each score has a corresponding progress bar, which updates in real-time. 
4. The user can choose to personalize their pet by uploading an image (via url) to the site.
5. The pet's score cannot exceed 100. If the pet's score reaches 0, the pet will die.
